description:  It all seemed too good to be true.
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all seemed too good to be true.Hither and thither through the meadows he rambled busily,along the hedgerows, across the copses,finding everywhere birds building,flower budding ,leaves thrusting everything happy,and progressive,and occupied.And instead of having an uneasy conscience pricking him and whispering 'whitewash!'  he somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog among all these busy citizens.After all, the best part of a holiday is perhaps not so much to be resting yourself,as to see all other fellows busy working.

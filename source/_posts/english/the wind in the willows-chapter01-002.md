description: The Mole had been working very hard all the morning,spring-cleaning his little home.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This is fine!' he said to himself. 'This is better than whitewashing!' The sunshine struck hot on his fur,soft breezes caressed his heated brow, and after the seclusion of the cellarage he had lived in so long the carol of happly birds fell on his dulled hearing almost like a shout. Jumping off all his four legs at once,in the joy of living and delight of spring without  its cleaning,he pursued his way across the meadow till he reached  the hedge on the further side.

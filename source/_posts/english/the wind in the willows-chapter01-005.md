description:  He thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along.
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river    . Never in his life had he seen a river before this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chucking,gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free,and were caught and held again.All was a-shake and a-shiver--glints and gleams and sparkles,rustle and swirl,chatter and bubble.The Mole was bewitched,entranced,fascinated.By the side of the river he trotted as one trots,when very small,by the side of  a man who holds one spell-bound by exciting stories;and when tired at last, he sat on the bank,while the river still chattered on to him,a babbling procession of the best stories in the world, send from the heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea.
